# Large Language Model Assisted Operator Design Framework (LLM-AODF)



## Introduction
Welcome to the official repository for the Large Language Model Assisted Operator Design Framework (LLM-AODF). This repository contains experimental results for our research on leveraging large language models to automatically generate and improve operators within evolutionary algorithms, specifically focusing on the Fireworks Algorithm (FWA).
